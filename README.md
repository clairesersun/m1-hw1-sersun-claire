I am a creator and movement coach. I hold a 200 hour yoga certification and a Personal Training Certification from the American Council on Exercise. I am a Moving For Life Certified Instructor, a BodyMind Dancing Associate, and am currently apart of Geometry Dance Company as a G2 artist.

## Past Coding Experience ##
